# about me
My name is Azura Muzdalifah, a fresh graduate from the Biology Department of Diponegoro University.

I've worked as a laboratory assistant and tutor throughout my college years.
The research project that I've done is mostly about tissue culture. In semester 5, I researched how different media affect Phalaenopsis subculture, and in semester 8, I researched the usage of Thidiazuron in Cymbidium bicolor somatic embryogenesis. I am intrigued by how plant cells can create a whole new plant by just a tiny part of it being cultured.
I tutored elementary, junior, and senior high school students for about a year. The subject I taught is Science and English

During my studies, I have been very fortunate to join and work in different organizations, such as the Biology Students Association as their head of Economic Research and  Development; NICHE Journalistic in the production and distribution division; and Environmental Concerned Group in the community dedication division.

Besides the research project, I  helped my family sell antiques. My late father owns many antiques, and after he passed, our family had a hard time with his antique possession, and I helped by selling them. I used many ways, such as via marketplace and a broker. 

I part-timed twice as a surveyor, the first time was with Telkomsel as their Market Research Surveyor, and the second time was with Pandawa Research, where I surveyed about the upcoming election. I also freelanced as a person in charge of CV Omega, the work experience I got from it was punctuality,  listening to orders, and being thorough with every decision I made because it affected the person I was in charge with. 

My recent work experience was with PT Muntira Kosmeditama, a cosmetic manufacturer, as their Marketing Officer and Content Creator, my job was spread awereness and build their brand image.
